# SafeEducation
First time attemp at making an Android application (:

The purpose of this app is to be able to know the crime rate in your Florida based city,

The goal in mind is that when parents are making a decision on what school their child should attend,

they can be aware of the crime rate around the area to make sure their child is safe.
